## What is that ?

A flood attack, in the context of computer networking and cybersecurity, is a malicious attempt to overwhelm a network or system with a high volume of traffic or requests, effectively disrupting its normal operation and causing it to become unavailable or significantly degraded in performance. Flood attacks typically aim to exploit vulnerabilities in a target system's capacity to handle incoming data or requests.

## Overview

This is a network flooder tool designed to send junk data into a target network, causing it to become overwhelmed and subsequently disabling its connections. This project is for educational and research purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

## Features

- Send junk data to flood a target network.
- Overload and disable network connections temporarily for testing and analysis.
